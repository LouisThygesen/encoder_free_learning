# BSc project: Encoder free learning of hierarchical VAEs
The repository includes all the code used to generate the results for the bachelor project report. To run experiments the code should be structured in a directory so that (1) the scripts from 'main' and 'models' is placed in a shared subdirectory (the name does not matter) and (2) the content of 'dataset' should be placed in a subdirectory called 'data'. The code runs on Linux.
